           SnapSpot was a prototype of a location scouting and social networking application geared towards photographers. The goal
           was to create an app that could compete with similar apps already on the market in terms of usability and functionality.
           We asked ourselves, <i>how might we be able to empower photographers to minimize the time they spend scouting locations
             through a curated search engine and collective community of photographers?</i>

         <p>
           To create a prototype that would solve our how might we statement, we had to begin with looking at the current market for any similar applications and
           completing user research. To find out the similarities and differences between the current applications on the market,
           we created a list to compare and contrast a list of features from three that we discovered.

          Out of the three applications, <i>Explorest</i> had the most features available and was the most versatile. While it was the most similar to what we wanted to create,
          the limitation of a free user made it difficult to access some information. Additionally, after comparing all three applications, we discovered a few problems:
        </p>
        <ul class="d-list sb-2">
          <li>Users have to have <b>specific</b> criteria in order to bring up locations. Rather than typing a generic location, there is no way for users to easily browse through locataions.</li>
          <li>Functionality of integrated maps are limited through free or premium labels or do not exist.</li>
          <li>Overall applications were not user-friendly (either too complex or too cluttered).</li>
          <li>Metadata exists, but is not extensive enough for users to properly utilise.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h5>user interviews</h5></p>
        <p>
          One of my roles was to conduct user interviews with photographers who identified as both hobbyists and professionals; I interviewed
          four individuals where half identified as each the former and the latter. Below is a portion of the list of questions I asked:
        </p>
        <ul class="d-list">
          <li>What level of photography would you classify yourself under?</li>
          <li>Do you use any photography or image-related mobile applications?</li>
          <li>How do you scout locations?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These were the top three questions that gave the most insight into their behaviors and patterns in terms of photography. From these interviews,
          it was important for me to note that professionals who shoot for magazines or editorials have no concern with scouting locations. On the contrary, freelancers and hobbyists often want or
          need knowledge of their current location.
        </p>

          <h5>key takeaways</h5>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hobbyists and professional freelance photographers would find a location app more useful; having a wide array of
              locations to utilize for shoots is beneficial for them and their clients.</li>
              <li>Most used apps mentioned by interviewees were <i>Instagram, VSCO, and Lightroom</i>, which are all photo-sharing or
              editing apps.</li>
              <li>All interviewees prefer to use apps that are free and do not require payments to access extra features or settings.</li>
            </ul>

        <p><h4>ideate</h4></p>
        <p><h5>personas</h5></p>
        <p>
          Following conducting user interviews, I created personas based on the list of key takeaways so I could gain further understanding of
          these photographers' perspectives. I listed out all the key takeaways from both user interviews and initial research and competitor analysis
          to create multiple personas. This helped us to empathize with our target audience and have the ability to focus on what key features we wanted
          to include in our prototype.

        <p><h4 class="sb-1">prototyping</h4></p>
        <p><h5>user & app flow</h5></p>
        <p>
          Before drawing the initial user flow, we made a list of features we wanted to include via our initial research and comparison of existing applications on the market. To begin prototyping,
          I created a generic user and app flow to map out the main pages and features that we wanted that reflected our main priority: to create a location scouting and sharing application that also
          emphasized the aspect of a collective community.

        </p>

        <p><h5>lo-fidelity wireframes</h5></p>
        <p>
          To further visualize how the user flow would work on the screen, I created lo-fidelity wireframes to map out some of the main
          features from our list.

        <p><h4>final design</h4></p>
        <p><h5>branding & ui kit</h5></p>
        <p>
          A part of my role for the project was to create basic branding and develop a UI kit for the application. The logo consists of a basic
          camera silhouette and a location marker icon that mimics the action of a camera flash. To keep the application as minimalistic as possible,
          I settled on two sans-serif fonts and a small selection of icons.
          <center><img src="https://gabriellengo.com/images/snapspot_ui_kit.jpg?raw=true" alt="snapspost ui and branding kit" class="img-fluid img-responsive sb-1 st-1"></center>
        </p>

        <p><h5>hi-fidelity prototype</h5></p>
        <p>
          I created a hi-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD as a part of our deliverables as well as for usability testing. While creating the wireframes,
          standardized my design by implementing Apple's iOS UI Kit to keep it consistent and familiar.
          <center><img src="https://gabriellengo.com/images/snapspot_fig_6.jpg?raw=true" alt="snapspot hi-fi wireframes" class="img-fluid img-responsive sb-1 st-1"></center>
        </p>

        <p><h5>usability testing</h5></p>
        <p>
          To conduct this test, I used the hi-fidelity prototype I created and allowed the users to explore the application. I used the same individuals
          from the interview process to test the final prototype. I asked users to make note of what they thought about the flow and if the app
          conveyed the list of initial ideas we had in mind for the final app.

        <p><h5 class="sb-1">key takeaways</h5></p>
        <p><h6>positive feedback</h6></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The design of the app was familiar to other Apple iOS applications</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the feature of having a map integrated within the application</li>
            <li>Population of the app by users allows more variety</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6 class="st-1">potential issues</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Social media aspect of sharing and posting seems unnecessary (compared to Instagram or VSCO)</li>
            <li>How would results populate if a user were to search a location on the map screen versus the search screen?</li>
            <li class="mb-4">If the apps locations are submitted by users, what type of criteria would be needed to validate a submitted location?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h6>solutions</h6></p>
        <p>
          Based on the feedback from usability testing, it seemed important to find a way to refine the social media aspect of the application.
          While many users stated that they wouldn't necessarily share and post photos if they had the option, they were interested in the possibility
          to share locations to users within the application. For the final prototype of the app, we decided to modify the social media aspect while still
          keeping the sense of community apparent. To simplify the social media aspect, we altered how photo posts would work for users.
          We limited the social interactions to only likes and removed the ability to comment on other people's posts. Additionally, the messaging
          function was changed to solely send locations.
