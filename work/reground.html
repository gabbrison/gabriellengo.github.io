         <p>
           This project was a study of the commercialization of the coffee industry in an attempt to ask ourselves <i>how might we maximize our knowledge by analyzing
          some of the current initiatives in coffee industry to establish a greater drive for standardized sustainability?</i> By taking a look at
          key insights, related to environmental and consumption practices, I built a case study around the North american coffee industry
          to identify a starting point to push for statndardization in the coffee life cycle between producers, consumers, and the environment.
         </p>
         <p>
           I designed a process book and document to analyze the research I had done over a four month period along with creating a brand
           to present the project under.

           Since the beginning of its commercialization and industrialization, issues regarding the coffee industry point to four key insights:
           solid and water waste, packaging and materials, consumption, and climate change. These are factors that have contributed to the increase in waste
           and need for sustainable practices in coffee farming and production. To analyze these key factors, I relied upon various research methods
           to gather information related to consumption, production, farming, and enviornmental impact and sustainability. To present my results,
           I designed a process book to document and analyze the research I had done over a four month period along with creating a brand to present
           this project under.

        <h4 class="sb-1">research</h4>
        <p><h5>surveys & interviews</h5></p>
        <p>
          I started my project by sending out a <b>survey</b> and doing in-person <b>interviews</b> with consumers and coffee shop owners, workers, and managers.
          The survey I created was focused on collecting quantitative data on how individuals consume coffee and on what different levels they
          engage with sustainable initiatives (both coffee-related and general everyday life). On the otherhand,
          doing brief interviews at local coffee shops in the metroplex allowed me to obtain qualitative data that could possibly
          support the quantitative data from the survey.
        </p>
        <p><h5 class="st-3">literature review</h5></p>
        <p>
          To extend my background knoweldge on the coffee production process, life cycle assesments, climate change, and environmental impacts,
          I researched extensive <b>articles, journals, and industry reports</b> to serve as my knowledge base for this project. Furthermore,
          the industry reports allowed me to do secondary research and analyzing on coffee corporations around North America. Additionally,
          <b>web searches</b> allowed me to find diagrams as well as easily accessible information regarding consumption, consumerism, the coffee
          production process, and coffee-related images, websites, and blogs.
        </p>
        <p><h5 class="st-3">ethnographic</h5></p>
        <p>
          Lastly, as someone who frequents caf√©s myself, I took on the task of ethnographic <b>observation</b> to observe and note consumer behaviors
          and actions and various shop environments to collect information that I might have not gotten throug my survey and interviews.

        <p><h5>analyzing the results</h5></p>
        <p>
          After my surveys, interviews, and intensive research period, I had to synthesize, analyze, and summarize all the information
          I had gathered thus far. My research covered everything from consumemrism to breaking down the process and impact of
          the coffee industry. For my process book, I was able to condense the key points from each section. Below are some excerpts from
          the book.

        <p><h5>sketches & ideation</h5></p>
        <p>
          I wanted to represent this project under a brand identity, so I began by brainstorming potential logos as well as attempting to ideate icons and images
          to use to associate with the brand. Sustainability was the main focus of this project and I wanted the brand to reflect that aspect. Additionally, I
          wanted to keep things minimalistic but apparent. From the sketches below, I gathered my ideas and inspiration and created a brand identity from my
          initial brainstorming process.

          To further show off the brand, I created some physical mockups for signage and merchandise.
