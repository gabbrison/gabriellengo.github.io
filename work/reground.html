           The commercialization of the coffee industry has grown exponentially, but not without a price. <i>How might we maximize our knowledge by analyzing some of the current initiatives and issues regarding the coffee industry to establish a greater
           drive for standardized sustainability?</i> By taking a look at key insights related to environmental and consumption practices, I built a case study around the North American coffee industry to identify a starting point that could potentially push the industry
           to begin standardizing our relationship (as consumers and producers) between coffee and the environment.

           Since the beginning of its commercialization and industrialization, issues regarding the coffee industry point to four key insights:
           solid and water waste, packaging and materials, consumption, and climate change. These are factors that have contributed to the increase in waste
           and need for sustainable practices in coffee farming and production. To analyze these key factors, I relied upon various research methods
           to gather information related to consumption, production, farming, and enviornmental impact and sustainability. To present my results,
           I designed a process book to document and analyze the research I had done over a four month period along with creating a brand to present
           this project under.

        <h4 class="sb-1">research</h4>
        <p><h5>surveys & interviews</h5></p>
        <p>
          I started my project by sending out a <b>survey</b> and doing in-person <b>interviews</b> with consumers and coffee shop owners, workers, and managers.
          The survey I created was focused on collecting quantitative data on how individuals consume coffee and on what different levels they
          engage with sustainable initiatives (both coffee-related and general everyday life). On the otherhand,
          doing brief interviews at local coffee shops in the metroplex allowed me to obtain qualitative data that could possibly
          support the quantitative data from the survey.
        </p>
        <p><h5 class="st-3">literature review</h5></p>
        <p>
          To extend my background knoweldge on the coffee production process, life cycle assesments, climate change, and environmental impacts,
          I researched extensive <b>articles, journals, and industry reports</b> to serve as my knowledge base for this project. Furthermore,
          the industry reports allowed me to do secondary research and analyzing on coffee corporations around North America. Additionally,
          <b>web searches</b> allowed me to find diagrams as well as easily accessible information regarding consumption, consumerism, the coffee
          production process, and coffee-related images, websites, and blogs.
        </p>
        <p><h5 class="st-3">ethnographic</h5></p>
        <p>
          Lastly, as someone who frequents caf√©s myself, I took on the task of ethnographic <b>observation</b> to observe and note consumer behaviors
          and actions and various shop environments to collect information that I might have not gotten throug my survey and interviews.

        <p><h5>analyzing the results</h5></p>
        <p>
          After my surveys, interviews, and intensive research period, I had to synthesize, analyze, and summarize all the information
          I had gathered thus far. My research covered everything from consumemrism to breaking down the process and impact of
          the coffee industry. For my process book, I was able to condense the key points from each section. Below are some excerpts from
          the book.
