           clients access information via the web portal, which was in need of an upgrade to become more modern, minimalistic, and mobile friendly. My role during this
           project was to redesign the web portal with mobility in mind. Throughout the duration of this project, I iterated through various wireframes to
           create a user flow prototype that would serve as a base for implementing a new web portal.

           To begin the process, I was shown what the web portal looked like; it was a very 2000s-esque interface and was nowhere near being mobile friendly.
           The goal was to make it as mobile friendly as possible while reorganizing and condensing multiple menus and minimizing clicks. To adhere to a
           design system, I referenced design guidelines from <a href="https://material.io" target="_blank">material.io</a> as a base for my wireframes
           and final prototype.

        <p>
          The challenge with the web portal was that it contains multiple levels of navigation; the main navigation exists but within different pages,
          but tabs are specific to the current page. When a user clicks on an organization and goes further down the portal, many options exist for each organization,
          profile, or member, where the tab-style navigation appears under a full menu. The user flow above was my attemnpt to make sense of how the different
          menus and content were nested within each other. Colored blocks indicate what section is currently selected on the tab-style navigation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          To build the mobile friendly portal, I began by sketching out the initial homepage following user login where I needed to decide what types of
          menus and navigations I could use. I searched the different menu types via <i>material.io</i>
          and landed on a bottom navigation bar (for lateral navigation) as well as hamburger menus (for forward navigation).
          Hamburger menus seemed more efficient and less confusing than using tabs for the nested menus. In addition to using hamburger menus for forward navigation,
          I also used cards on certain pages.

          </p>
        </center>
        <p>
          The wireframes above were a way for me to sketch out how to reorganize the portal in a way that was minimized and intuitive. I felt that using
          hamburgers and cards for forward navigation made sense, despite there being a hamburger menu within the lateral navigation. To differentiate this,
          the color of the forward navigation would differ from the lateral by color and which side it appeared on. I decided to have lateral navigationi
          appear from the left whereas forward would appear from the right. Back navigation was to be represented by a simple back arrow on the top left
          of the screen. Taking my wireframes, I was able to create a <i>user flow wireframe</i> within Adobe XD.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><h5>user flow wireframe</h5></p>
        <p>
          Below is an overview of the final user flow wireframe as well as a simple walkthrough video that shows the functionality of the nested menus. The three
          colors on the lateral navigation bar help to differentiate the main hamburger menu from a nested forward hamburger navigation menu. Since there
          was no particular style for how the web portal was supposed to look, I followed the basic design of using basic cards and screens to mainly show
          the functionality of how the portal would work.

          The user flow wireframes shown above were used as the base to create a modern and mobile-forward web portal for CoreClarity. With
          the new design of how the portal would work, CoreClarity could move forward and create a more user-friendly portal to minimize confusion
          and maximize a client's experience using the application.
