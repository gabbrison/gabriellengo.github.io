					<b>introduction</b> hi! my name is Gabrielle Ngo and I am currently an undergraduate
					student at The University of Texas at Dallas. I'm studying for a BA in 
					Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communications with a Focus on Design and Production
					as well as a minor in Computer Science. My passion is solely to create; whether
					that be through photography, writing, or design, my intuition and drive continues
					to grow on a daily basis. This site hosts my portfolio, and with that, I thank you
					for stopping by and hope you can find something that suits your tastes.
